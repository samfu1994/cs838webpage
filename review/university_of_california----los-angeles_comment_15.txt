I have only been at UCLA for one quarter and am still astonished with how hard students work, and their interest in overcoming academic and social challenges. I am grateful to be attending this school because of the academic rigor and the multitude of opportunities available for career-minded people. The professors are very knowledgable and helpful despite some large classroom sizes. There are several easily accessible cafes and dining services provided by ASUCLA.
