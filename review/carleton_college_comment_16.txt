Diversity here is okay. The school has a crazy liberal bias and if you're not an ultra-liberal, prepared to be called a "racist" or "sexist" rather quickly. Ethnic diversity is lacking, but that's rather common among top liberal arts colleges. Economic diversity is slightly better, and there is also a vibrant LGBT community as well.
