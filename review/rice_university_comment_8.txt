Classes were intense and workload was heavy, and since pre-meds are everywhere, grade deflation may be practiced at times in some classes, which hurts a bit. Professors were mixed - some were amazing teachers, while others were clearly research-first and didn't know students by name even in <20-person classes. However, the latter were also people I learned a lot with when I started working in labs, so I think it made up for it (small student-to-faculty ratios ensured that anybody who wanted to work in a lab typically got to do it).
