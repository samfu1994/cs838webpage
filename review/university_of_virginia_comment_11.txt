UVA is a great school with many opportunities to succeed. Classes aren't always easy, but they're not supposed to be and there are many resources available for help. There is a wide range of organizations, cultures, and classes on display, although the sheer amount of NOVA students is annoying. "Grounds" (campus) are well maintained, but areas like McCormick Road get extremely crowded at times. First-year dorms are all well-furnished, but bring a fan for old dorms and prepare for a hike from Gooch/Dillard. New dorms are nice and close to the main areas of UVA. Food is so-so, ranging from good to bland/repetitive. Plus dollars and meal exchange are welcome alternatives to dining halls, although Newcomb is always good(but is crowded and runs out of stir-fry often) Parties are fun, but getting into one without paying or an insider is hit-or-miss. The football team's struggles are well-known, but other teams are excellent.
