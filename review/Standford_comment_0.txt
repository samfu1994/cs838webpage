In Stanford, collaboration comes before competition. Once you have proved worthy of being in Stanford, it is not about what grades you receive and how you are better than someone else purely in academics, but about how you reach out for different experiences, how you enrich yourself with multi-disciplinary research activities, how you participate in year round activities on campus and help each other out in academics. It isn't how much you know, it is how well you use what you know. It doesn't matter what field you are in, Stanford will give you the holistic experience of studying in a University that no one else can. Don't be afraid to apply, I was very afraid, but I took the leap and here I am.
