Courses can be a bit limited in variety in smaller departments, but the interactions you have with profs makes up for it. Classes a mostly discussion-based, although some intro classes lean on the side of interactive lecture rather than just pure discussion. Class sizes for non-science majors are fantastic and average around 10-25, depending on the prof's popularity. Science class sizes tend to be on the larger side, by Carleton standards, at around 40-60 or more for intro classes. The best departments by far are political science, biology, chemistry, geology, religion, psychology, math, and English, while the weakest are sociology/anthropology, linguistics, physics, statistics, and economics.
