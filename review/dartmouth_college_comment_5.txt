As I have suggested previously in this survey,  1 out of every three classes I have taken EVERY trimester has been very poor.  Not just "not great" but actually very poor!  One teacher out of every three has been a terrible teacher, or extremely difficult to understand and often their tests are extremely unfair and do NOT reflect the material taught in class.  When the entire class performs poorly, the grades are curved so it appears that everyone did adequately, but the reality is that in those classes we have NOT learned, we have lost an opportunity to get excited about a topic probably lost a spark of interest to further explore an academic area.  For the tuition we pay, we should have phenomenal teachers and when students complain about a professor year after year, they should at least NOT be teaching introductory classes.    I am not alone in feeling extremely disappointed in the overall teacher quality, at least during the first two years' introductory level classes.    Don't get me wrong - there have been some very good teachers too - but the ratio of terrible teachers to great teachers is not what it should be at an IVY League school
