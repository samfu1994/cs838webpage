I've been in and out of Columbia, but it really in a unique school, being ivy league full of hyperintelligent high achievers without feeling like a machine made to churn out sociopathic moneymakers. It loves the arts and it loves rebellion. Students are PASSIONATE and they won't just show off for a class -- so many people choose to start businesses, hold protests, make differences, make art, do whatever it is they love. I currently am CEO of 2 companies I founded -- a webzine for genderqueer issues and a clothing line. Only thing is I wish that it could be more relaxed. When I was a freshman, it felt competitive and uncomfortable for me, like students didn't want to learn as much s they just wanted to be impressive, so I dropped out and transferred to Pratt with a massive scholarship. I returned a few years later in the school of General Studies, which is way more flexible and easygoing, especially when it comes to the core curriculum. I think the rest of Columbia should gradually make its way towards operating more like GS.
