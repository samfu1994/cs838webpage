I was really unsure when I first arrived at UVA because I thought it was going to be really preppy rich kids, and while there is a crowd of those type of kids, I was very surprised to find a large group of like-minded individuals who share the same interests and values as myself.  Charlottesville is a great city with lots to do.  The classes at UVA are usually very good with great, knowledgeable professors.
