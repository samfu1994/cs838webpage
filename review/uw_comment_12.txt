The University of Wisconsin Madison is located in a very beautiful location. The campus is large and has many great opportunities for involvement. The professors are very helpful and are usually available outside of class. There are many class choices and there are very diverse learning experiences. I would recommend everyone to take a look at this school. The facilities are for the most part very nice. I would like to see some older buildings to be renovated.
