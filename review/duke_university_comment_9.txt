I could not have made a better choice in coming to Duke. Duke is everything I ever wanted and strives to positively surprise and impress me every single day. The campus is absolutely gorgeous, the food is excellent even for freshmen (although some complain about the meal plan, which I and most people I know personally love), the housing is so great I never feel homesick, the party scene is great if you're into it (if you're not, there's plenty else to do), academics are top notch (and incredibly challenging), and the people here are amazing. I've made lifelong friends in just one semester. To say that I love Duke is too little. It has made me grow in ways I did not know that was possible, kept me happy at every time, and challenged me academically in a way I did not consider possible. For me, it is the best institution of higher education in the nation, and I highly recommend it to all of my high school friends.
