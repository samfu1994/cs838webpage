I did 1 year in freshmen housing in a single. I was very quiet and kept to myself. Small room, hallmates really gossipy. Typical ugly dorm furniture and that carpeting. You know the carpeting. I like living alone off-campus. Don't like being "watched" much or having to sign people into my home as an grown adult.
