the snooty lit society / co-ed frat for alt kids ADP where i got roofied as a freshman is the most lusted after because of its elitism and mystique. i was recruited, attended the event for maybe 45 min and left. people seemed nice I just didnt feel compelled to join. all the others are just, dudes sitting around or ethnicity-specific sororities that mostly do charity. I don't know too much about them.
