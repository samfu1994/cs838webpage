What I like about University of Pennsylvania is that it's a diverse college that gives students the freedom and tool they need to move on and become an adult. There are many opportunities to make friends and find clubs that fit people's intrest. I also love how every day you can find something new to expect on campus since people would hold events that are entertaining. involving and find someone that has similar intrest. Timing is pretty flexible for classes so balancing school and social life is good. Lastly I love how there are many campuses around Pennsylvania which makes it even more flexible for people all over the world to have an opportunity to go to one of the Penn State campuses.
