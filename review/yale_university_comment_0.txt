I think what makes Yale what it is is the people. Everyone here has something about which they're incredibly passionate, and you feel that in the buzz of energy around campus-- everyone is always busy doing something, meeting someone, or going somewhere. While it can sometimes be hard to find your niche (isn't it always, though?, especially with so many deeply invested Yalies, it's ultimately become a home and a place with so many incredible memories, so much academic and personal growth, and so much I'll miss when I leave. We're already planning our reunions.
