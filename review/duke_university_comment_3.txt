Duke University has the most beautiful campus i have seen so far. If you are into basketball and want to go to school with good return on investment, then Duke University is the school for you. It is also located 10 minutes away from Downtown Durham and has a really good transportation system for those who commute or do not have a car. I particularly like the Duke Van which is free service that is great for those who want to stay on campus after 11pm to study and live about 1 to 3 miles from campus. In my graduate program, there are people from over 20 different countries and we are not even up to 50 in my class of 2018. I am a grad student and don't have meal plans but i seriously wish i did because Duke has the place campus food i have ever had and this is coming from someone that has gone to two colleges in the United States in Illinois and Maryland. Overall, i will recommend to anyone who wants a well-rounded college experience.
