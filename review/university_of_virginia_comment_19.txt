Being at the University of Virginia for almost a whole semester, I can honestly say that it has been the best and most interesting months of my life.  Everyone is super nice and friendly, including the teachers. It wa really for me to fit in and get comfortable so I am grateful. This university definitely lives up to its hype by continuing its awesome traditions and making this truly a great place to be at. I wouldn't be at another college.
