I thoroughly enjoy my experience at Virginia Tech. This is my second year, and I know that I made the right decision. The academics at challenging, but more than worth it. The professors and staff offer many resources for help, and as a student body we continuously help one another. Campus life is great, and always refreshing because I never run into the same faces.
