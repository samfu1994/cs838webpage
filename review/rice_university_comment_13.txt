As a senior graduating this May, I could not be more satisfied with my experience at Rice. The small student population and the residential college system create a close-knit, family-like atmosphere, but because most students live on campus you still have the chance to meet new and interesting people every day. Overall, I would describe Rice as open-minded, quirky, competitive, supportive, intellectually stimulating, and fun. Due to its size, social structure, and focus on the undergraduate experience, Rice has many of the advantages of liberal arts colleges, but with the added benefits that come with its status as a top research university with resources and opportunities of much larger schools.
