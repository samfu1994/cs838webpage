UVA is honestly the best school.  I've had nothing but the best time so far during my 1st year.  We have such a great school spirit which really draws everyone in to support each other.  There are over 500 clubs, so you can find anything that fits your interests.  If you have any interest in singing, acapella is huge here and is a great way to make friends and meet a network of other talented people.  It is the perfect cross between top ranked academics and the social aspects of a state school.  UVA is the place to study hard, have fun, and try things you never thought you would.
