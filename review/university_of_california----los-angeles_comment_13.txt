UCLA is a great university. With that being said, it is a very rigorous one. The class sizes can be large but I have had no problems because you can always sit closer. The social life is really interesting as you can always go out to the sporting events, hangout in Westwood, or just relax by streaming movies provided by the university. Oh, we also have some amazing food. Overall, I would highly recommend this university.
