I am a male, and fairly strong so the issue of safety is different for me than for women.    I have never felt unsafe in terms of any violent crimes etc.  I don't have any friends that have been victims of sexual assault, but I have friends whose friends have been assaulted.    Obviously alcohol plays a role but  the school has made significant  efforts to limit alcohol availablity.  I put N?A for support services and administrative support for victims of sexual assault, only because I don't really know, since I haven't had any first hand experience with anyone involved with this.
