Additionally, because Dartmouth is out of the way for most companies, their engineering recruiting fairs are extremely lacking in depth and availability.  Much of the fair is online.  Being only 3 hours from Boston, The Thayer school of engineering should host a weekend or trip to Boston for a recruiting fair to coincide with all the other colleges there when there are HUNDREDS of companies available to talk to and connect with.  Students could take a bus to Boston and even make up the classes that are missed at some later point if necessary.   Job hunting and internship opportunities are far inferior than at many other schools, even if they are not as highly ranked as Dartmouth!
