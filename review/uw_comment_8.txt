I love the campus set up and how there's two sections. There is the city section which we call "Southeast" and then there's "Lakeshore'. Theses are two very different scenes that give u a taste of the city life and a taste of nature. What I am disappointed in is the lack of diversity. There are very few Black, Asian, and Hispanic students on campus and I wouldn't be disappointed if UW wouldn't have advertised just how diverse their school was. I was shocked when entering this campus environment to discover just how few people of color there truly is and the lack of inclusivity experienced by minorities. Many of the white people have never even seen a person of color before. So my advice for UW is don't advertise your campus' diversity if you truly barely have diversity.
