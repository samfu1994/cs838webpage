There is a great feeling of pride and accomplishment when you are surrounded by your incoming class at UCLA; the ones who were chosen to come to such a great school. I love being on-campus. A plethora of opportunities, clubs, and activities are readily available on campus as well. And the sports are always exciting to watch, especially when we win. I personally enjoy being on the quarter system, some people disagree. Ten weeks of instruction is just the right amount of time for me. I've had no bad experiences yet because I've only been in Westwood for just one quarter, however, I'm sure I'll be able to handle them. If you get accepted into UCLA and have the chance to go I say take it! The experience is what you make of it and UCLA is all ready an adventure in itself.
