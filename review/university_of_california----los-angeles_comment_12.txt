I'm currently a third year at UCLA and I love it! The campus is gorgeous and there's always a new study spot to discover. All of my professors have been very kind, helpful, and learning from them is a privilege. They always have office hours and are willing to give you advice for getting the most out of their class or just life in general.  It's also nice that Westwood is pretty close! There's always good food around.
