Virginia Tech is a very beautiful campus, all seasons long.  Lots of options for the outdoor lover with nearby attractions such as The Cascades, McAfee Knob,  and the Dragon's Tooth trail. Very spirited and service-oriented community, which is why the campus is considered the heart of Blacksburg. Go Hokies!
