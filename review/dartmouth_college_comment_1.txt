I am a current sophomore ('19), and I had a great freshman year, but I waited for this past Fall term to confirm that Dartmouth is, in fact, one of the best choices I have made in my life. Dartmouth has a small community in which everyone knows each other directly or through one degree of separation (which can be a pro and con at times!), but it's so easy to find a sense of self here and be integrated into a great community as well. Everyone knows stress levels are high, so hiding it does no good, but the community is incredibly supportive regardless.
