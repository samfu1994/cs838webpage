The University of Virginia is an all around great school. The buildings are aesthetically brilliant, and nothing is ever too far. Charlottesville is such a beautiful area. From its plentiful trees and rolling hills, everything is so tranquil. A view of the fog-covered mountains is always just a couple minutes away.
