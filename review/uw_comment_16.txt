The University of Wisconsin- Madison is incredible in academics. I am a science major and the school puts impressive money and funding into increasing the ability for students to have good academic experiences. The university, however, struggles with getting students to participate in an inclusive environment. Minority students find it quite hard to feel accepted and as though they belong. It is often assumed that a student of color got accepted into the university to fill some quota rather than for their academic excellence.
