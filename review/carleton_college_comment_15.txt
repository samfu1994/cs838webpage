Phenomenal. Professors are for the most part excellent, and very few are concerned about only doing their research. Most are friendly, although a few can be a bit hard to approach, the vast majority are kind and willing to help students in office hours. Curriculum is a bit limited given the amount of faculty, so course diversity in smaller departments is lacking. Registration is easy and you can almost always get your first-choice classes, depending on your interests. Workload is pretty high, but then again this depends on your major and how you balance your classes. Study abroad is crazy popular and most do it at least once in a country of their choice - the Cambridge program is excellent.
