On campus food is awesome. The restaurants around town are okay overall. The campus is gorgeous, there's always something to do and there are plenty of resources available. The people are incredible and I love being a student here. The only thing that sucks is the parking, but if that's all there is to complain about, VT is doing a phenomenal job.
