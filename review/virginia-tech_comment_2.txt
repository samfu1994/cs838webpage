Virginia Tech is the by far the best choice I have ever made. The Hokie Spirit here is unreal and anyone and everyone will reach out a helping hand to assist you in whatever your questions may be. The food here is spectacular, the environment is always positive, and everyone is proud to be attending VT. Any major you decide to pursue there are people waiting eagerly to help you succeed. VT is the best all around, period.
