Rice is a fabulous school. A smart, interesting, and diverse student body, dedicated professors, amazing academics, the residential college system, and a not-too-small but not-too-big student population overall create a university that anyone applying to colleges would be sorry to pass over without further research. Everyone I talk to here says this is the college for them, and they cannot imagine being happier anywhere else.
