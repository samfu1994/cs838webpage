26 fraternities, so there's one for everyone. Being in a fraternity isn't hard, but the top fraternities are as good as they come. Very nice houses in great locations in Boston and Cambridge. Chi Phi, Sigma Chi, and Delta Kappa Epsilon throw some of the best parties in Boston, each with their own unique vibe.
