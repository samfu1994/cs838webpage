Courses at Rice University are difficult and challenging, but it is the challenge they present that make taking classes there worth the effort. The majority of professors are diligent and open, very willing to help those students who make an active effort in class and to learn the material. The classroom environments motivates through competition with my peers, competition with the professor to prove myself, but it does not overwhelm me or put me down.
