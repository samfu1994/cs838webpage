I would definitely choose Dartmouth again.  I love the spirit of the school, the people, the professors and all  of the non-academic learning experiences that are available.  I think in the Engineering school there is a lot of room for improvement in terms of consistently having consistently good teachers.  For the most part, teachers are good in the entry level classes, occasionally there is a great teacher, but often ( so far 1 class out of three, every trimester) there is one teacher who isvery suboptimal in their ability to teach or communicate well.  Not acceptable at this type  of school.
