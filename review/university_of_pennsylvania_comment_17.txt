I am a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania and I absolutely love it. The people here are incredible, kind, and inspiring. Classes are difficult and there is a heavy workload, but not enough to create unhealthy stress. I enjoy the food in the dining halls, and the numerous clubs available for involvement.
