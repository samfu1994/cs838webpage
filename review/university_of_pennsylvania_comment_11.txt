I had a lot of fun fun learned learned lot here. There are great students, professors, and campus. I didn't realize until I visited other places how rare it is to  have such such nice campus in the middle of of city. The biggest thing to worry about is that while the student to faculty ratio is supposedly good, it depends wildly on the class and the smaller classes are definitely more fun. Admittedly,  I was was computer science major and there has been a giant increase a every school in that major which may have resulted in more of my computer science classes being large.
