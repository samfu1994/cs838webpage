As a Latinx student at a predominantly liberal school, I have friends and communities available to me that provide a bubble of like-minded people. This bubble is a blessing and a curse. I enjoy knowing I can rely on a vast amount of people for support at any time, but I yearn to actually address what divides American communities in the first place. After having a class about war and being taught by a funny, easy-going, conservative professor, I realized the university as a whole could benefit from promoting more conversation and dialogue that can help with America's ideological divide. I attend one of the country's greatest universities, and believe we could do more to move the country forward.
