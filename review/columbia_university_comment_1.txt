Columbia University became like a home to me. I was connected to Columbia through the Double Discovery Center since i was a freshman in high school, and later on in the summer of 2016 I completed the Freedom and Citizenship program. During the Freedom and Citizenship program, I lived on campus and attended daily seminars led by professor Dan-El Padilla Peralta for the entire month of July. I think Columbia University is a perfect place where someone can express who they are and be surrounded by brilliant people.
