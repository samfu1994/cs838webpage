I enjoy the school spirit and Badger pride students and staff at this University have. Some classes are not as good as others but that can be expected anywhere. The classes that I enjoyed were taught by professors who were fantastic and truly have a passion for the topic they are teaching. The classes I didn't enjoy were graded unfairly and were often taught by professors who seemed to not have as much passion. The campus climate isn't always great, specifically when it comes to race. Although I do feel safe on this campus most of the time.
