UCLA is seriously overcrowded, the administration bureaucracy is absolutely terrible, and the competition in all reasonably hard majors is cutthroat. There are almost always three ppl to each tiny dorm room and realistically the average student will have almost all huge classes (the number of small classes they advertise is misleading because you need tons of small classes to balance out one large class from the student perspective -the smallest class I've had in three years was a 60 ppl). Many classes (especially math, science, econ) are specifically designed to weed students out of worthwhile majors and often have test averages below 50%. Class enrollment is a nightmare -you will likely only be able to get 2/4 classes you need each quarter. And I can't even describe the amount of bureaucratic bs I've had to go through, especially with the Registrar, Undergraduate counseling, and the Econ department. Also our football team sucks
