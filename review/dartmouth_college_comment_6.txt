I am concerned about my future opportunities, mostly because it has been difficult to secure worthwhile internships.  Freshman summer internship opportunities were limited both by limited exposure to companies to apply to, since there is no on campus career fair in the engineering school and by the limited course background.  Sophomore internship was difficult for the above reasons adn additionally because the trimester off during sophomore year that is required is not when many companies hire college interns - they do it in the summer when all the Dartmouth sophomores have to be at school.
