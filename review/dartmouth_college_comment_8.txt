Only issue with housing has to do with the Dplna, where students leave campus for 1 trimester during their sophomore year.  This requires a lot of moving in and out of dorms.  it also means that during the sophomore year, your friends that you made during Freshman year are never all at school on campus at the same time.  Each trimester that you are at school during sophomore year, people that you care about, or are learning from or working with are constantly coming and leaving campus for several months at a time and it is a bit of a negative.  Sophomore summer when everyone is there again is really nice.  Unfortunately, then in Junior year, people start leaving again to do a semester abroad.
