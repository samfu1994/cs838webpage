I visited the campus many times and have done a lot of research on this school as well as know many of its alumni. First off, the food is fantastic. There are so many options because it is located in Philadelphia and there are many food trucks near the campus if not on the campus.  Its business school is ranked number one, you have a lot of hands on practice in class, working with local companies and Fortune 500!! It is just amazing and the students are super friendly.
