Apart from the academics, what I love about this school are the honest, and selfless majority that go to this school. No matter where or when you loose your wallet, there will always be a student that will do everything in their power to help you out. However, we lack diversity. No matter how many international students Virginia Tech allows to enroll, the university will auto segregate and isolate those who cannot identify themselves in one niche. The problem stems from the fact that the majority of the students come from a bubble called NOVA (Northern VA). NOVA has its own sub-culture, and it dominates the school. Me and all of my friends raised outside of the NOVA area feel isolated sometimes by our inability to relate to this majority. It is even worse for minority students. Furthermore, everyone conforms to pop culture, and if you don't conform, you will be isolated even more. Conforming is just another part of the NOVA culture.
