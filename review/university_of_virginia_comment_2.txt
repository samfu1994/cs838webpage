In addition to the curriculum, I find the culture of the school to be incredibly unique and diverse. Of the myriad of clubs and organizations on Grounds, it is easy to find somewhere you belong. Sure, there are several groups that are exclusive, and several people that I would not be sad not to see again, but they are few and far between. Once you find your niche, this place really is home.
