As a graduate student, I'm very impressed with this research university. As one would expect from an Ivy League school, funding is usually never an issue for research projects or social events. The libraries have some of the rarest books in the world, a very rare and delightful opportunity indeed. The professors are world famous and you'll easily see them on television for interviews. This school is a little more traditional than the other Ivies as can be seen by it still being called Dartmouth College and not Dartmouth University, even though it is a respectable research university make no mistake. Dartmouth is understated elegance, just the way it should be. Since this school is the smallest of the Ivies, it is the easiest to network in and will surely pay off in the long term. Dartmouth opens doors and there is a reason why the Ivies are so sought after on this planet, but you'll just have to find out for yourself exactly what I mean.
