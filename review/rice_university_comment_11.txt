I definitely could not have made a better choice than deciding to come here. The residential college system helps new students develop strong friendships with each other and acts as a source of support when needed. Although classes are hard, it's easy to reach out for help when you need it; the professors are extremely helpful and are willing to help you out if you're willing to ask for it. TL;DR. Rice University is absolutely amazing and I could not be happier at any other school.
