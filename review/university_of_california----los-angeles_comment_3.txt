UCLA is a fantastic school.  The breadth of academic offerings is unparalleled.  I went here because of the high number of different course offerings.  The professors were consistently of a high quality and were interested in engaging their students.  Coming from a small private K-12 school, I felt as though students here were not as interesting as they were in grade school.  They were sadly closed-minded and overall uninterested in broadening their horizons with the vast amount of knowledge that UCLA's professors brought to the table.  The upside to this is that I got to know my professors very well, spending a lot of extra time with them during their office hours to get to know them and their work better.
